# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
Pulls together scrum and agile practices


    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by listening to my clients and their goals. User stories can help with this due to the understanding you gain from your client. It is essential to put the customer first, so that you do not create something they did not want. When creating a program for a client, it is important that you make something that extends to, or past their vision and expectations.     
    
    
    
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 I should approach developing programs just a painter would approach painting. The prep work is most of the battle and can save you a lot of time if done correctly. Many people think developing programs is mostly coding, but that is not necessarily the case, even in large scale projects. Complex programs require lots of planning and cooperation between your team members. I hope to incorporate the agile process of sprints into my future development work because it makes the goals seem attainable. Oftentimes it is hard to wrap your head around large scale projects, but easier to do so with small scale projects. It is possible to break up these large processes with agile, and is something I hope to use in my future development work.   
    
    
    
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means to be honest with yourself and your fellow team members. Not everyone will know everything and that is okay, it is important that everyone is aware of their faults or misunderstandings so that they can be addressed as soon as possible. Reliability is important trait of a good team member as false promises can lead to bad relationships and hate within or outside of your team. Another important aspect of a good team member is to resolve your conflict within the team. Teams work best when they are not plotting against eachother, but instead, working together.
